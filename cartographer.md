# carto installation

guide at [https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compilation.html](https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compilation.html)

Up until this point everything worked fine, but when I try the next step
```
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO} -y
```
I get the following error message:
